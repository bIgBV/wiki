    More P vs NP

* The circuit stat problem is a NP complete problem, meaning that all other NP problems can be reduced to this problem.
* Therefore, if we can solve this problem in polynomial time, we can solve all other NP problems in polynomial time.
* Any algorithm that takes a fixed number of bits as input, we can create a cirtuit representing the problem and the circuit itself will be poly size. Not only that, if we have a certifier for this algorithm, we can check a given advice in poly-time
*
