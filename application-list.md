## Programming history

I've been programming for a little over 6 and a half years. When I first started I mostly built web application in python, learning to program by building my own CMS framework for my personal blog. I joined Recruiterbox, as a full stack developer. I learnt a lot during my time there, performing in various different roles such as building features for our application, taking ownership of triaging issues with out customer facing teams, handling our deployment pipeline and being a part of the on call rotation if any issues came. I was also part of a team dedicated to improve the overall performance and the experience of our application, bringing down the page load times from 2+ minutes for our larger clients to around 14 seconds  across the board.

I started pursuing my masters after two years at Recruiterbox, wanting to improve my fundamentals and focus on systems and scalability problems.  All through my masters I've been working on learning systems programming by working on projects such as building a simulation of a distributed system to validate Encoded Vector Clocks, build asynchronous client libraries for Beanstalkd. I also interned at Cisco systems during this summer working in their VIC firmware team, learning the inner workings of datacenter networking and high performance firmware. I helped automate services in the datacenter and work on fixing issues with the firmware of their high performance 40+ Gigabit network cards.

Currently, I am working on my masters project which is adding a network stack to XV6, a teaching operating system.

    * I worked as a full stack web developer for two years. During the tail end of that job, me and my team lead spent lots of time improving the performance of our web application, bringing down load times from 2+ minutes to 14 seconds (99 percentile) across all clients. This work involved making lots of small changes over time, instrumenting and measuring the affects of our changes and iteratively working on top of them.

    This taste of performance engineering sparked what became my reason for wanting a masters degree. To better my computer science foundations and learn about how to build systems at scale. And I feel that my masters degree was completely worth it. Not only am I learning how performant systems are built and designed, I'm also getting a chance to see the real world effects of such decisions in my classes. On top of that, interning in the Cisco VIC firmware team gave me another opportunity to learn how to build software built to run at the cutting edge of modern data center networking speeds.

    Therefore, my experience and my drive to build systems at scale combined with my comfort of thinking about system design and picking things up quickly mean that I'm a good fit for this role.

    * GitHub is where open source happens. I've been programming since close to 6 years and during that entire time, GitHub has been an integral part of the learning experience for me. Be finding new libraries or just coming in touch with other open source developers who have taught me valuable lessons. To be able to get a chance to work at an organization which enables such work to happen is an amazing opportunity which I would do everything in my power to bring to fruition.
    * I've not worked in a remote position before, but having worked with an extremely remote team, I feel that the biggest challenge of working remotely is communication.

    Communication is key even when not working remotely, but being in the same physical location makes a lot of things simpler. Things like asking for help from someone or for their opinion becomes a matter of just talking to them at the right time. But this becomes a little challenging when using text based asynchronous modes of communication.

    One of the best solutions I've previously used are video calls. It might be a little more involved in scheduling one, but the advantages of quick video calls to catch up with teammates and to just in general talk to people when working remotely makes it so that you come across a part of the team and have an open channel of communication which can be utilized as necessary.
